Title: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Description: In this project, we developed a machine learning model to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The model uses the K-Means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning technique.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: We collected customer data, including features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.
Data Preprocessing: We cleaned the data by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: We selected relevant features that contribute to customer segmentation.
Model Training: We applied the K-Means algorithm to cluster the customers into different groups. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method.
Evaluation: We evaluated the model by visualizing the clusters and interpreting the characteristics of each group.
Results: The model successfully segmented customers into distinct groups, allowing the business to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
